<p>This data directory is used by several of the other LINQ samples. Note the 
copy of the database entitled <strong>Northwind.mdf</strong> found in this 
directory. This is a custom version of
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=06616212-0356-46a0-8da2-eebc53a68034&amp;displaylang=en">
Northwind</a> database that is used by many Microsoft products. Changes made to 
this database include the addition of new stored procedures and fields designed 
to show off particular LINQ features. There is a second copy of this database in 
the <strong>SampleQueries</strong> project. Two copies of Northwind were shipped 
so that <strong>SampleQueries</strong> can be copied easily as a discrete entity 
from one location to another. If you move other samples, such as <strong>
LinqToNorthwind</strong>, you would also have to bring this <strong>Data</strong> 
directory along with it.</p>
<p>Other files found in this directory include various small XML files that are 
used by some of the other LINQ samples. Note that these XML files are again 
duplicated in the <strong>SampleQueries</strong> directory, for the same reason 
outlined above.</p>
<p>It is important that the files in this directory are not marked as read only. 
Many of the samples will not run correctly if these files have their read only 
attribute set. In particular, you may have trouble connecting to the Northwind 
database unless you have permissions to both read and write to <strong>
Northwind.mdf</strong>.</p>
<p>The following text, which summarizes some of the information explained in 
this file, is duplicated in most of the other ReadMe.html files included with 
the LINQ samples:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Many of the LINQ samples require XML files and/or the version of the 
Northwind sample database that is located in the Data sample. If you 
install the Data sample under the same parent folder as the other LINQ 
samples, then the path for the XML files and database file will be 
resolved automatically. Many of the sample files also require the 
ObjectDumper project.</em></p>
