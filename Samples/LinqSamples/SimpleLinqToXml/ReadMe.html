<p>The sample is a short introduction to System.Xml.Linq building on the
user's familiarity with the XML DOM API. The goal is to illustrate how to
construct a predefined XML document using Linq to XML. Two different approaches
are showcased. First, the document is assembled using XML DOM-like API (see
CreateDocumentVerbose()). Note the various options to add nodes into the 
document. The second approach known as functional construction is a more 
concise style that achieves the same result (see CreateDocumentConcise()). 
The sample also shows a method of traversing the document (see DumpNode()). 
Note the familiar properties exposed on the various node types.</p> 

<p>Many of the LINQ samples require XML files and/or the version of the 
Northwind sample database that is located in the Data sample. If you 
install the Data sample under the same parent folder as the other LINQ 
samples, then the path for the XML files and database file will be 
resolved automatically. Many of the sample files also require the 
ObjectDumper project.</p>
