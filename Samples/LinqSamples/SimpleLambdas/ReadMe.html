<p>Simple example of using Lambdas. Most programmers will want to work with Query
Expressions. However, Lambdas can be useful in some circumstances, and this sample
provides a quick introduction to the subject.</p>

<p>There are 11 samples in this project. By default you will run the first sample.
If you edit the Main() method in <strong>Program.cs </strong>you can modify the code
    to run one of the other 10 samples. For instance, by default, main calls:</p>

    <pre>        Samples.Sample1();</pre>
    
<p>Modify this code to call Sample2():</p>

    <pre>        Samples.Sample2();</pre>
    
<p>
    The samples are named Sample1(), Sample2(), etc, up to Sample10(). Accompanying
    Sample9() there is also a method called Sample9a().</p>
